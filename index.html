                <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</li>
               <br> <li>In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his CURRENT score. </li>
               <br> <li> BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, all his CURRENT score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. </li>
               <br> <li> The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn. </li>
               <br> <li> A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row on any of the dice. After that, it's the next player's turn.
</li>
               <br> <li>The first player to reach Winner score entered by user on GLOBAL score wins the game.</li>
